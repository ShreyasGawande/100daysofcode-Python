# Mathematical Operations:

Important thing to remember is the rule PEMDASLR

>Every operation goes from Left to Right so important to remember Multiplication and Division has same weightage but whichever comes first on Left is performed first same goes    with Addition and Subtraction.


- Paranthesis () 
- Exponential **
- Multiplication * or Division / (Depends on which is on left i.e LR)
- Addition + or Subtraction - (Depends on which is on left i.e LR)



# f-string:

    score = 30
    height = 1.8
    print(f"your score is {score} , your height is {height}")
   
So thing to notice is that using f-string you dont need to concatenate and change type .
